# Project Overview

This project is a **Geometry Dash-like** game built with **Godot 4.4**.

## Key Objectives
- Create a platformer game similar to Geometry Dash with obstacles, blocks, and player movement
- Implement an AI system that will learn to play the game autonomously using **deep learning**
- The AI should be able to navigate through levels, avoid obstacles, and complete challenges without human input

## Technology Stack
- **Game Engine**: Godot 4.4
- **Language**: GDScript (primary), potentially Python for AI training
- **AI/ML**: Deep learning implementation for autonomous gameplay

## Game Structure
The game follows a standard Geometry Dash format with:
- Player character that moves automatically forward
- Various block types and obstacles to avoid
- Level-based progression
- Physics-based gameplay mechanics

## AI Learning Component
The AI component will:
- Observe game state (player position, obstacles, etc.)
- Learn optimal actions through reinforcement learning
- Improve performance over multiple training sessions
- Eventually play the game better than human players
